1. About

slapt-src is a utility to make querying, retrieving, and building slackbuilds as
easily as working with binary packages with slapt-get.


2. Features

  * Remote and local SlackBuild repository support
  * fast
  * more

3. Requirements

  * slapt-get
  * curl

4. Installation

Currently slapt-src is only available via git.  See
http://software.jaos.org/git/slapt-src/

After unpacking, run ./autogen.sh.  After the configure script is built, run
the usual ./configure && make.

5. slapt-srcrc

The slapt-srcrc file consists of the following keys:
  * SOURCE
  * BUILDDIR
  * PKGEXT
  * PKGTAG

Refer to the slapt-src(8) man page for more on the configuration format and options.

Source should point to a local or remote SlackBuild repository that contains
the necessary meta data.  See SLACKBUILDS.TXT below.

6. SLACKBUILDS.TXT

The following script can generate the currently supported format of SLACKBUILDS.TXT.
The filename and format are likely to change.

#!/bin/bash
set -e

for sb in $(find . -name '*.SlackBuild' | sort)
do
  name=$(basename $sb | sed -re 's/\.SlackBuild$//')
  location=$(dirname $sb)
  if [ -f $location/$name.info ]; then
    echo "SLACKBUILD NAME: $name"
    echo "SLACKBUILD LOCATION: $location"
    files=$(ls $location | xargs)
    echo "SLACKBUILD FILES: $files"

    # remove those pesky multi line listings for each interesting field
    TMP=$(mktemp)
    sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\\\n*\s*//g' $location/$name.info > $TMP

    DOWNLOAD=$(grep ^DOWNLOAD= $TMP | cut -f2 -d\" )
    DOWNLOAD_x86_64=$(grep ^DOWNLOAD_x86_64= $TMP | cut -f2 -d\" )
    MD5SUM=$(grep ^MD5SUM= $TMP | cut -f2 -d\" )
    MD5SUM_x86_64=$(grep ^MD5SUM_x86_64= $TMP | cut -f2 -d\" )
    VERSION=$(grep ^VERSION= $TMP | cut -f2 -d\" )

    echo "SLACKBUILD VERSION: $VERSION"
    echo "SLACKBUILD DOWNLOAD: $DOWNLOAD"
    echo "SLACKBUILD DOWNLOAD_x86_64: $DOWNLOAD_x86_64"
    echo "SLACKBUILD MD5SUM: $MD5SUM"
    echo "SLACKBUILD MD5SUM_x86_64: $MD5SUM_x86_64"

    if [ -f $location/slack-desc ]; then
      SHORTDESC=$(grep ^$name: $location/slack-desc | head -n 1 | sed -re "s/^$name://")
      echo "SLACKBUILD SHORT DESCRIPTION: $SHORTDESC"
    else
      echo "SLACKBUILD SHORT DESCRIPTION: "
    fi

    echo
    rm -f $TMP
  fi

done > SLACKBUILDS.TXT
gzip -9 SLACKBUILDS.TXT -c > SLACKBUILDS.TXT.gz

# END
